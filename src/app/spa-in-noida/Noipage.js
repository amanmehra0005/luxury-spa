  {
    question: "Where is your spa in Noida?",
    answer:
      "Our spa in Noida is close to the Sector 18 market, a short ride from DLF Mall of India and The Great India Place. We send the exact location on WhatsApp as soon as your slot is confirmed. And if you don't feel like going anywhere, we can come to your home or hotel instead, anywhere in Noida or Greater Noida.",
  },
  {
    question: "I'm near Sector 18. Is yours the best spa in Noida Sector 18?",
    answer:
      "We'd never call ourselves the best, that's for you to decide. What guests tell us they like is the private room, being able to pick their therapist, and knowing the price before they walk in. Our outlet is right by Sector 18, so it's easy to fit in after work or after a few hours at the mall.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a body massage in Noida cost with you?",
    answer:
      "A 60-minute body massage at our Noida spa starts at ₹1,999. Home and hotel sessions are ₹14,999 for 90 minutes, and our 120-minute 5-star package is ₹19,999. We confirm the price on WhatsApp before you book, and that's what you pay.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a therapist come to my home in Noida for a massage?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Our home spa covers most of Noida, Noida Extension, Gaur City and Greater Noida. The therapist brings fresh towels and oils, so you only need a quiet room with a bit of space.",
  },
  {
    question: "I live in Gaur City, Noida Extension. Will you come that far?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we visit homes in Noida Extension (Greater Noida West), including Gaur City 1 and Gaur City 2, as well as Jagat Farm and the rest of Greater Noida. Send your society name and tower on WhatsApp and we'll give you a time.",
  },
  {
    question: "I work in Sector 62. Can I get to your spa easily from there?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A lot of our bookings come from people working in Sector 62 and 63, and from the societies around Sector 104 and the Expressway. You can visit our outlet near Sector 18 or book us at home.",
  },
  {
    question: "I want a Russian spa in Noida. Do you have Russian therapists?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Our team includes therapists from Russia, Uzbekistan and Thailand along with Indian therapists. Guests looking for a Russian massage in Noida can request a Russian therapist when they book.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you have Thai massage in Noida?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Our Thai therapists do the traditional style on a mat, with stretching and pressure points and no oil. It's a good choice after a long day at a desk in Sector 62.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we book a couple massage in Noida?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Two therapists work at the same time in one private room, either at our outlet or at your home or hotel. It's popular for anniversaries and birthdays.",
  },
  {
    question: "What about B2B or sandwich massage in Noida?",
    answer:
      "Yes, both are available in a fully private room. Message us on WhatsApp and we'll explain each one, along with timing and price, before you book.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it possible to get a massage late at night in Noida?",
    answer:
      "Our booking desk on WhatsApp runs 24 hours, so you can message at any time. Late evening and night slots depend on which therapists are free, so it's best to book a few hours ahead.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I choose a female therapist?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Male guests can ask for a female therapist, and female guests can choose a male or female therapist. Mention it when you book and we'll confirm who is available.",

              If you&apos;ve been looking for a massage spa in Noida, you&apos;ve probably noticed there are a lot of
              them, and it&apos;s hard to tell them apart from the photos. So here&apos;s simply how we work. You get a
              private room to yourself, you can choose your therapist, and we tell you the price on WhatsApp before you
              come. Nothing gets added to the bill later.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed text-bodycolor">
              Our outlet is near Sector 18. A lot of our guests drop in after work, or after a few hours at the mall.
              Some people would rather not go out at all, and we understand that, so we also send therapists to homes
              in Noida, Noida Extension, Gaur City and Greater Noida.
