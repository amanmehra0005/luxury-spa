    question: "Where is your spa in Lajpat Nagar?",
    answer:
      "Our spa in Lajpat Nagar is close to Central Market and a few minutes from Lajpat Nagar metro station. Guests from Lajpat Nagar 2 and Lajpat Nagar 4 usually reach us in minutes. We send the exact location on WhatsApp as soon as your slot is confirmed.",
