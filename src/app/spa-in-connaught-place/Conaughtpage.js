    question: "Where is your spa in Connaught Place?",
    answer:
      "Our Connaught Place spa is at The Park New Delhi, 15 Parliament Street, a few minutes from Patel Chowk and Rajiv Chowk metro stations. If you're staying at another CP hotel, such as The LaLiT, The Imperial or Shangri-La Eros, our therapist can come to your room instead.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you have a Russian spa in Connaught Place?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Our Russian spa in Connaught Place has Russian, Uzbek and Thai therapists as well as Indian therapists. Tell us who you'd like when you book, and how firm you want the pressure, and we'll match you with the right person.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes you one of the best spas in Connaught Place?",
    answer:
      "Guests usually mention three things: private rooms inside a 5-star hotel, prices we fix on WhatsApp before you come, and being open 24/7. You also choose your therapist and the type of massage, so the session is built around you rather than a set menu.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a massage in Connaught Place cost?",
    answer:
      "A 60-minute massage at our Connaught Place outlet starts at ₹1,999. A 90-minute session in a hotel suite is ₹14,999, and the 120-minute 5-star hotel spa package is ₹19,999. There are no hidden charges.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a spa near the Metropolitan Hotel in Connaught Place?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The Metropolitan Hotel is on Bangla Sahib Road, a short drive from our outlet at The Park on Parliament Street. Many guests staying near Gole Market and Bangla Sahib come over to us. Message us with where you're staying and we'll tell you the quickest way to reach us.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are you different from massage parlours in Connaught Place?",
    answer:
      "Many massage parlours in Connaught Place work out of small rooms with shared spaces and prices that change at the counter. We work from a 5-star hotel, every room is private and cleaned after each guest, our therapists are trained and certified, and the price you see on WhatsApp is the price you pay.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is your Connaught Place spa open late at night?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we're open 24/7. Office workers in CP often come after 9 p.m., and hotel guests book us late at night after a long day of meetings.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I choose a female therapist?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Male guests can ask for a female therapist, and female guests can choose a male or female therapist. Mention it when you book and we'll confirm who is available.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I book a massage in Connaught Place?",
    answer:
      "WhatsApp us or call +91 87997 16197. Tell us the massage, the time, and whether you'll come to The Park or want us at your hotel. We confirm the slot and the price on the same chat.",

              Connaught Place is busy at every hour. Office crowds, shoppers on Janpath, tourists walking the inner
              circle. When people look for the best spa in Connaught Place, they usually want three simple things: a
              clean private room, a therapist who knows what they&apos;re doing, and a fair price they know in advance.

              That&apos;s what we do. Our CP spa sits inside The Park hotel, so it&apos;s calm the moment you step in.
              Choose a full body massage, a couple session or a deep tissue massage for that desk-job back, and book
              it in one WhatsApp message. Prefer to stay in? Our therapists visit the big Connaught Place hotels every day.
