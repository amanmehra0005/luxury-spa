  {
    question: "Do you have a spa center in Chandigarh?",
    answer:
      "We don't have a walk-in spa center in Chandigarh. Our therapists come to you instead, at your home or in your hotel room, anywhere in the tricity. Plenty of our guests actually prefer it, since there's no driving back afterwards.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the full body massage price in Chandigarh?",
    answer:
      "A 90-minute massage in your hotel room is ₹14,999, and our 120-minute 5-star package with an international therapist is ₹19,999. For a massage at home, the price depends on your sector and how long you'd like, so we confirm it on WhatsApp first. Ask for today's offer while you're at it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you come to Sector 35, Sector 8 and Sector 17?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Sectors 8, 9, 17, 22, 26 and 35 are where most of our Chandigarh bookings come from, and we go to the other sectors too. Send your sector on WhatsApp and we'll tell you when the therapist can be there.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you come to Mohali, Zirakpur or Panchkula?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we cover the whole tricity, including Mohali, Zirakpur, Panchkula, Manimajra and Baltana. If you're staying in a hotel near Chandigarh airport, we can come there as well.",
  },
  {
    question: "I'm shopping at Elante Mall. Can I get a massage nearby?",
    answer:
      "Since we don't have an outlet, we can't take you in at the mall. But if your home or hotel is nearby, book us for after you're done shopping and the therapist will meet you there.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer Thai massage in Chandigarh?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Our Thai therapists do the traditional style on a mat, with stretches and pressure points and no oil. It's what people usually pick after a long drive or a day on their feet.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a Russian spa in Chandigarh?",
    answer:
      "Our therapists from Russia and Uzbekistan do take bookings in Chandigarh, along with our Thai and Indian therapists. Let us know who you'd prefer and we'll check who's free on your date.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I book a Russian therapist in Chandigarh?",
    answer:
      "Send us a WhatsApp on +91 87997 16197 with your sector or hotel, the time you'd like and \"Russian therapist\". We'll check who's free that day and confirm the therapist, time and price on the same chat. Booking a day ahead gives you the best chance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we book a couple massage at home?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Two therapists come together so you can both have your massage at the same time. A living room or a hotel suite usually has enough space for it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer B2B massage in Chandigarh?",
    answer:
      "Yes, B2B massage is available as a private home or hotel session. Message us on WhatsApp and we'll explain how it works and what it costs before you decide.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can men book a massage? Can I ask for a female therapist?",
    answer:
      "Of course. Men and women both book with us. Male guests can ask for a female therapist, and female guests can choose a male or female therapist. Just mention it when you book.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I book, and how do I pay?",
    answer:
      "Call or WhatsApp +91 87997 16197 with your sector and a time. We confirm the therapist and price on the same chat. You pay after the session, by UPI, cash or card.",

              Most people searching for a massage in Chandigarh want the same thing. A good therapist, a clean and
              private setting, and a price they know before they start. What they don&apos;t want is to finish a
              relaxing hour and then fight for parking outside a market. So we left the spa center out of it. You
              book, and the therapist comes to you.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed text-bodycolor">
              We get a lot of requests from Sector 8, Sector 9 and Sector 35, plenty from Sector 17 and 22, and quite
              a few from people staying in hotels in Mohali and Zirakpur. It doesn&apos;t really matter where you are,
              though. If you&apos;re in the tricity, just ask.
