    question: "What is a sandwich massage?",
    answer:
      "It's a full body massage done by two therapists at the same time, one on each side of you. They time their strokes together, so it feels like one long, even wave instead of two separate massages. Most people find they relax a lot faster than with a single therapist.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a sandwich massage cost in Delhi?",
    answer:
      "At our outlets, a sandwich massage starts at ₹1,999 for 60 minutes. A 90-minute session in a hotel suite is ₹14,999, and the 120-minute 5-star package with foreign therapists is ₹19,999. We confirm the price on WhatsApp before you come, so there are no surprises.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I find a sandwich massage near me in Delhi?",
    answer:
      "We have 24+ outlets across Delhi NCR, including Aerocity, Connaught Place, Karol Bagh, Lajpat Nagar, Saket and Dwarka, plus Noida and Gurgaon. Send us your location on WhatsApp and we'll tell you which one is closest.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a sandwich massage take?",
    answer:
      "Usually 60 to 90 minutes, which gives both therapists enough time to cover your whole body without rushing. If you want longer, our 5-star package runs for 120 minutes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is a sandwich massage safe for everyone?",
    answer:
      "For most healthy adults, yes. If you're pregnant, recovering from an injury or have a medical condition, check with your doctor first and tell us before the session so the therapists can adjust.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get a sandwich massage in a 5-star hotel?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Our therapists work with hotels like Andaz, The Park, The Suryaa and Welcomhotel by ITC Dwarka. If you're staying at one of them, we can set up the session in your room.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I book a sandwich massage?",

      "Message us on WhatsApp or call +91 87997 16197. Tell us the time, the outlet or hotel you prefer, and whether you'd like Russian or Indian therapists, and we'll confirm your booking.",

              So what is a sandwich massage? Think of a normal full body massage, but with two therapists instead of
              one. One stands on your left, one on your right, and you&apos;re the filling in the middle. That&apos;s
              where the name comes from. They move at the same pace, so after a minute or two you stop noticing
              there are four hands. It just feels like one long, slow massage.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed text-bodycolor">
              Honestly, whether it turns out to be the best sandwich massage you&apos;ve had or just an okay one comes
              down to the two therapists. If one is quick and the other slow, it gets distracting. We pair ours up so
              that doesn&apos;t happen.

              Most people don&apos;t think about the oil, but you&apos;d notice if it was wrong. If it&apos;s too thin,
              it dries up in five minutes. If it&apos;s too heavy, you feel sticky for the rest of the day. So for a Delhi
              sandwich massage, we use a light oil. We warm it a bit first so it isn&apos;t cold on your skin. You can
              add lavender, eucalyptus, sandalwood or rosemary if you like. Just ask.
