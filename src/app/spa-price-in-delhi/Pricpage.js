    question: "What is the spa price in Delhi at Luxury Russian Spa?",

      "A 60-minute massage at any of our outlets is ₹1,999. A 90-minute session at your home or hotel is ₹14,999, and our 120-minute 5-star hotel spa package is ₹19,999. Those are the full prices, with no extra charges added at the end.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a full body massage cost in Delhi?",
    answer:
      "A full body massage at our outlets costs ₹1,999 for 60 minutes. If you'd like it at home, a 90-minute full body massage at home in Delhi is ₹14,999.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a 1-hour body massage cost in Delhi?",
    answer:
      "A 1-hour body massage at any of our outlets costs ₹1,999, whichever massage you pick. If you want longer, a 90-minute session at home or in your hotel is ₹14,999.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the price different in Mahipalpur, Lajpat Nagar or Uttam Nagar?",
    answer:
      "No. We keep the same rates at every outlet, whether you're in Mahipalpur, Lajpat Nagar, Uttam Nagar, Paharganj or anywhere else in Delhi NCR. The only things that change the price are the length of the session and where it happens.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Thai massage price in Delhi?",
    answer:
      "A 60-minute Thai massage at our outlets is ₹1,999, the same as our other massages. It's done on a mat in loose clothes, with no oil.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does a couple spa in Delhi cost?",
    answer:
      "Couple massage prices depend on how long you'd like and whether it's at an outlet, your home or a hotel suite. Send us those details on WhatsApp and we'll give you the exact price before you book.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I book a 90-minute session at an outlet?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Longer outlet sessions are available, and we'll confirm the price on WhatsApp when you book, since it depends on the massage and the outlet.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in the price?",
    answer:
      "Your massage, a private room, fresh towels and linen, the oils, and a hot shower afterwards at the outlet. For home visits, the therapist brings towels and oils with them. Tips are never expected.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are you a cheap spa?",
    answer:
      "We're not the cheapest massage in Delhi, and we don't try to be. What you pay for is a private room, a trained therapist you choose yourself, and a price that doesn't change once you're on the table. If a place quotes much lower, it's worth asking what's left out.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any offers or discounts?",
    answer:
      "We run offers from time to time, especially for first visits. Just ask for today's offer when you message us on WhatsApp.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to pay in advance?",
    answer:
      "Not for outlet bookings. You pay after your session, by UPI, cash or card. For home and hotel visits we'll explain the payment when we confirm your booking.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is the home or hotel price higher?",
    answer:
      "Because the session is longer, 90 minutes instead of 60, and the therapist travels to you with everything needed. You also skip the travel time and can go straight to bed afterwards.",
